A simple Python 3 Script to find an equation for a multivariable function based on 3 stationary points. A local 
maximum, local minimum and a saddle point. Could easily be adapted for more stationary points. 

Mostly uses the Sympy library.

See example.py for how to use this.

Was something I created for a small project I did. PR are appreciated, this was something I quickly created so there 
may be some bugs.
